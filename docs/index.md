## Jonathan Hunt
I strive to become an effective leader by following the teachings of those with more experience than me, and by lifting others when I can. Helping others learn and grow has always and will always be my focus. 

I believe great accomplishments can be done when you work together as a team. My “why” of working in Healthcare Administration is to lift everyone as a whole by small and simple act of service, and make a diffrence in indivudals lives for the better.
